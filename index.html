            <h1>About Me</h1>
      
            <img src="./assets/images/aboutme.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="My Face">

            <p>I'm an audio engineer and musician, living in Orange County.
            I've been working in the music industry for the past 20 years, starting out as a musician in a
            punk band in 1998. I've been lucky to tour the world, playing with bands that I looked
            up to growing up. To this day, I've continued to make albums, both solo and in bands.</p>
            
            <p>In 2005, I shifted gears towards a focus on the "Behind The Scenes" aspect of the music industry.
            I travel working as a touring Front-of-House Live Sound Engineer, a Stage Manager, as well as a Tech. 
            During my off-time from the road, I produce and engineer records in recording studios across Southern California, 
            but most frequently at my studio, Bright Lights, in Santa Ana.</p>

            <p>After 20 years of living out my childhood dreams beyond my imagination working in the music industry,
            I am focused on becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. I am currently enrolled at the UCI Coding Bootcamp,
            with aspirations to strengthen my skillset and to forge a new path with an exciting and new career. </p>
